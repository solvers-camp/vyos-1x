# TACACS+ configuration file

# This is a common file used by audisp-tacplus, libpam_tacplus, and
# libtacplus_map config files as shipped.
#
# Any tac_plus client config can go here that is common to all users of this
# file, but typically it's just the TACACS+ server IP address(es) and shared
# secret(s)
#
# This file should normally be mode 600, if you care about the security of your
# secret key. When set to mode 600 NSS lookups for TACACS users will only work
# for tacacs users that are logged in, via the local mapping. For root, lookups
# will work for any tacacs users, logged in or not.

# Set a per-connection timeout of 10 seconds, and enable the use of poll() when
# trying to read from tacacs servers. Otherwise standard TCP timeouts apply.
# Not set or set to a negative value disables use of poll(). There are usually
# multiple connection attempts per login.
timeout={{ tacacs.timeout }}

# to use of pam_mkhomedir.so). This flag is ignored for users with restricted

# per-command authorization (see the tacplus-restrict man page).
